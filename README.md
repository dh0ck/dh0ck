### Antonio Lara (dh0ck)

Hi, I'm Antonio, a Security Engineer and open source enthusiast. Welcome to my repo, where I share little (and not so little) projects that at some point I needed to create for my own, but that I think can also be helpful to others.

If you are a pentester/bug bounty hunter, check my <a href="https://github.com/dh0ck/Headers">Headers</a> repo, the source code for a Burpsuite extensions that I created to make my life easier, and that Portswigger accepted in the <a href="https://portswigger.net/bappstore/f12b0f468c0942ceadeb56cfe642885b">BApp store</a>
