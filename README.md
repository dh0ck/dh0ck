### Antonio Lara

Hi, I'm Antonio, a Security Engineer and open source enthusiast. Welcome to my repo, where I share little (and not so little) projects that at some point I needed to create for my own, but that I think can also be helpful to others.

If you are a pentester/bug bounty hunter, check my <a href="https://github.com/dh0ck/Headers">Headers</a> repo, the source code for a Burpsuite extensions that I created to make my life easier, and that Portswigger included in the <a href="https://portswigger.net/bappstore/f12b0f468c0942ceadeb56cfe642885b">BApp store</a>

Also, check out my popular <a href="https://github.com/dh0ck/Wi-Fi-Pentesting-Cheatsheet">Wifi pentesting cheatsheet</a> if you are learning about WiFi hacking, or if you are studying for Offsec's OSWP PEN-210 exam.
